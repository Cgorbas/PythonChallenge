In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial recoffd of your company.  give a set of financial data called budget_data.csv.  the dataset is composed of two columns:  Date and Profit/Losses.  (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple).

your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
   -The total number of months included in the dataset
   -The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period
   -The average of the changegs in Profit/Losses over the entire period
   -The greatest increase in profits (date and amt) over the entire period
   -The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

as an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:
   Financial Analysis
   ---------------------------
   Total Months:  86
   Total:         $3828
   Average Change: $ 289383
   Greatest increase in profits:  feb   ($131423)
   Greatest decrease in profits:  feb   ($-131423)

   -in addition, final script should print the analysis to teh terminal and export a text file with the results
